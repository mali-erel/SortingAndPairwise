# SortingAndPairwise
This homework done by me for Algorithm 1 class.

Question 1 contains various types of sorting algorithms such as Insertion, Merge, Quick that sorts the Route class. Route class contains String source and String destination. If the sourses are same than sort destination-wise.
Also, Quick sort algorithm has an addition. If the recursive method in quick sort loops more than 2, rest of sorting carried with merge sort.

Question 2 prints the least pairwise absolute difference between the n integers in an array together with the associated pair of numbers. After the pairing, using various sorting algorithms, cheking how fast the algorithm completes.
